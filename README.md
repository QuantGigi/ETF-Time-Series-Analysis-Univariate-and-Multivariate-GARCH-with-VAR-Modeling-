# ETF Time Series Analysis ‚Äî Univariate & Multivariate GARCH with VAR Modeling

## üìä Overview

This academic project simulates a client-oriented analysis, performing a time series study on three ETFs representing different asset classes and geographic exposures. The objective is to assist a hypothetical client in portfolio diversification by studying return dynamics, modeling volatility using univariate and multivariate GARCH models, and analyzing interdependencies through a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) approach.

## üìà ETFs Analyzed

- CW8.PA - Amundi MSCI World UCITS ETF (Global Equities)

- CRP.PA - Amundi EUR Corporate Bond Climate Paris Aligned UCITS ETF (Corporate Bonds, Climate-aligned)

- LGQM.DE - Amundi Pan Africa UCITS ETF (African Equities)

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze historical returns and basic statistics of selected ETFs.

- Model conditional volatility with GARCH(1,1) models.

- Explore joint volatility dynamics with multivariate GARCH-BEKK models.

- Analyze interdependencies with VAR models and study cross-market reactions via Impulse Response Functions (IRF).

## üî¨ Methods & Models

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Analysis**

- Annualized returns

- Volatility (standard deviation)

- Skewness and kurtosis

- Autocorrelation functions (ACF)

**2Ô∏è‚É£ GARCH(1,1) Modeling**

- Estimate conditional volatility per ETF

- Study shock sensitivity (alpha) and volatility persistence (beta)

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Multivariate GARCH-BEKK**

- Capture joint volatility and time-varying correlations between ETF pairs

**4Ô∏è‚É£ VAR Modeling & Impulse Response Functions**

- Study interdependencies between ETFs

- Analyze how shocks propagate across markets

## üìÇ Data

- Frequency: Weekly data

- Period covered: April 2018 ‚Äî March 2025

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool

- R (RStudio)

## üîé Key Findings

- Global equities (CW8.PA) show persistent but moderate volatility.

- Corporate bonds (CRP.PA) are relatively stable but can experience extreme events.

- African equities (LGQM.DE) exhibit high volatility and strong sensitivity to shocks.

- Diversification benefits reduce significantly during global crises (e.g. COVID-19 2020).
